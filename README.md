# Computer-Accessories-shop

BACKEND.

I have developed a desktop application, precisely a static webpage using HTML,CSS, javascript, bootstrap framework. This site assumes a computer shop where buyers can view the different accessories of computers available for sale before they make their order.Buyers view the computer accessories through spinning the wheel by clicking a button named specification.This wheel rotates 90degrees in the anticlockwise direction taking 1second, to display each item. The direction and angle of rotation can still be adjusted.Besides, there's warm background, header and footer, spelling the joy of owning a computer and it's accessories.

GETTING STARTED:

To develop, test and run this project, you are required to clone the project in your local machine, install all the dependencies like editor, and then execute the related COMMANDS on "localhost:8080". Note that some inline codes have been used. Also,note that CSS's bootstrap framework has been linked directly from the HTML code in the <head>tag.This means that for it to work,you will have to connect your local machine to the internet. Alternatively, you can download the bootstrap v5.1 and include it in the project folder. The page is designed to fit in small,medium or large screens. So,according to the size of your screen, select in the divs either col-sm, or col-md, or col-lg.Being that this project is a static webpage, no database is needed for it.
